# VBN Test Data

This directory contains **VBN test cases** used to verify and validate the image-processing pipeline (FeatureDetector + StaticPoseEstimator).

We store **cases** (inputs + metadata + results) in a consistent folder format so that:
- the same C++ runner can be used for both simulated and real camera data,
- results can be re-generated without deleting the original inputs,
- performance can be swept later (Monte Carlo / parameter sweeps) and visualized offline.

## Directory layout

- `cases/`  
  Repository of test cases.
  - `cases/sim/` — simulated cases generated by `tools/sim/vbn_simulator.py`
  - `cases/hw/`  — real hardware captures (camera frames + notes)

Only lightweight files are intended to be tracked in git (README + folder structure). Actual generated images/results can be ignored via `.gitignore` as needed.

## Case folder concept

A **case folder** is the smallest unit of testing. A case folder is designed to be:
- generated by a simulator or captured on hardware,
- consumed by the C++ test runner,
- optionally post-processed by analysis scripts later.

### Case naming

We will use a simple, human-readable case directory name.

Recommended formats:
- Simulated: `CASE_SIM_<date-time>_<tag>`
- Hardware:   `CASE_HW_<date>_<tag>` 

(e.g. `CASE_SIM_20251225-035824_10cm_Yaw3_01`)

Avoid spaces. Prefer underscores.

### Contents

Common files (both sim + hw):
- `image.png` — input image for the C++ pipeline
- `results.txt` — pipeline outputs + timings + config used for that run
- `*_annotated_*.jpg/png` — optional debug overlays (visual verification)

Sim-only additions:
- `preview.png` — 8-bit preview for quick viewing
- `truth.txt` — ground truth + simulator metadata (`key = value`)

Hw-only additions:
- `notes.txt` (or `notes.md`) — capture context (ground truth, exposure, gain, lighting, etc.)
