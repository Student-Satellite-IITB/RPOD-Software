This image is taken from the V4L2 pipeline with pattern very close to camera (~ 10 cms)
Exposure (lines)= 50 lines 
V4L2 sensor subdev settings: 1280×800, HB=250, pixel_rate=160,000,000:
line_length = 1280 + 250 = 1530 px
line_time = 1530 / 160e6 = 9.5625 µs
Exposure = 50*9.56 = 478 µs


Note that reprojection RMS error is higher because the pattern seems to disobey the given geometry 
and the centroid according to brightness weights is not at the center of the LED due to non uniform lighting inside the LED.
